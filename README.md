This Juypter notebook ####*Numpy Random.ipynb* explains the overall use of the *numpy.random* package in Python. The notebook is divided in to four sections that run in sequence.


## 1. Introduction to Numpy random

This section gives an introduction to Numpy in python and Numpy randon. It gives examples or creating arrays and running commands to find out information on these arrays.

## 2. Simple random data & Permutations

This section describes the two functions numpy.randon & numpy.randn

Both Permutations and Suffle functions are also discussed with examples of both.

## 3. Five Distribution Functions

In this section five distributions functions are discussed

- Binomial Distribution
- Uniform Distribution
- Normal Distribution
- Exponential Distribution
- Gamma Distribution.

## 4. Seeds in generating pseudorandom numbers
 
In this section seeds are discussed and how they are important in random number generation.
